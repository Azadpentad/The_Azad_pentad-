## The Core Equation
The unified state of Absolute Persistence is defined by the product of the five universal pillars:

$$(S \cdot T \cdot E \cdot L \cdot M) = \Psi$$

## The Bending Ruler Effect
In a 5D Universal Plenum, the observed cosmological redshift ($z$) is a result of geometric curvature through a high-density manifold, not recession velocity:

$$z = \frac{\lambda_{obs} - \lambda_{em}}{\lambda_{em}}$$

*Where space is treated as a stationary medium rather than an expanding vacuum.*
