(S+T+E+L+M) = Psi

## The Core Equation
The unified state of Absolute Persistence is defined by the product of the five universal pillars:

$$(S \cdot T \cdot E \cdot L \cdot M) = \Psi$$

## The Bending Ruler Effect
In a 5D Universal Plenum, the observed cosmological redshift ($z$) is a result of geometric curvature through a high-density manifold, not recession velocity:

$$z = \frac{\lambda_{obs} - \lambda_{em}}{\lambda_{em}}$$

*Where space is treated as a stationary medium rather than an expanding vacuum.*

**Official Reference:** #17680744 | **Status:** Open Research

## The Core Equation of Absolute Persistence
The universe is a stationary, high-density 5D manifold. The unity of its dimensions is expressed as:

$$(S \cdot T \cdot E \cdot L \cdot M) = \Psi$$

### Definition of Variables:
- **S (Space):** The 5-Dimensional manifold geometry.
- **T (Time):** The state of Absolute Persistence (Non-linear).
- **E (Energy):** The density of the Universal Plenum.
- **L (Life):** The biological resonance within the manifold.
- **M (Mind):** The conscious observer effect.

## The "Bending Ruler" Rectification
The current "Hubble Tension" and "Crisis in Cosmology" exist because mainstream physics assumes a 4D vacuum expansion. The Azad Pentad rectifies this through the **Bending Ruler Effect**:

- **Expansion is an Illusion:** Redshift is not caused by galaxies moving away.
- **Geometric Curvature:** Redshift is caused by light curving through the high-density 5D Plenum over vast distances.
